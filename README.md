This repository contains documentation and code for a data science project that involves two tasks: data collection and predictive modeling of customer bookings.

## Task 1: Data Collection - Web Scraping

### Project Overview

In this task, we will collect data from a website using web scraping techniques. We aim to gather information about [insert website name or description] and store it in a structured format for further analysis.

### Requirements

Before running the code for data collection, make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

### Data Collection

To collect data from the website, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `web_scraping.py` file.

3. Modify the code to target the specific website and data you want to collect.

4. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python web_scraping.py
   ```

5. The scraped data will be stored in a CSV file named `scraped_data.csv`.

### Usage

You can use the collected data for various data analysis and visualization tasks, depending on your project's goals.

### Contributing

Contributions to this data collection task are welcome. If you have improvements, bug fixes, or new features to add, please follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the repository.

2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.

3. Make your changes and commit them with clear and concise messages.

4. Push your changes to your fork.

5. Create a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch.

## Task 2: Predictive Modeling of Customer Bookings

### Project Overview

In this task, we will perform predictive modeling for customer bookings using machine learning techniques. The objective is to build a model that can predict whether a customer's booking will be completed or not based on various features and attributes related to the booking.
